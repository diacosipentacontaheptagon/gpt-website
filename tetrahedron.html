    <h1>\(S_4\) and the Tetrahedron</h1>
    <p>
      \(S_4\), the symmetric group on \(4\) elements, has an interesting
      homomorphism to \(S_3\). Observe \(S_4\) is the isometry group of the
      tetrahedron, and the tetrahedron has \(6\) edges: each has an 'opposite edge'
      it is not adjacent to, and there are \(3\) such pairs. Permuting the four
      points permutes the three pairs, giving a homomorphism \(S_4\) to \(S_3\).
      Nothing quite like this map exists for any other symmetric group.
