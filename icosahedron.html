    <h1>Outer Automorphism Group of S_6</h1>
    <p>The symmetric group S_6, consisting of all the permutations of 6 elements, has a unique and intriguing property: it is the only symmetric group with a non-trivial outer automorphism group. The outer automorphism group of S_6 is isomorphic to the group Z_2, which has two elements.</p>

    <h2>Permutations and Symmetries</h2>
    <p>In the world of group theory, permutations play a crucial role in understanding the symmetries of mathematical objects. The symmetric group S_6, in particular, helps us explore the symmetries associated with six distinct elements, such as the vertices of a regular hexagon.</p>

    <h2>A Glimpse into Automorphisms</h2>
    <p>Automorphisms are structure-preserving transformations within a group. The outer automorphism group captures the essence of automorphisms that are not inner automorphisms. In S_6, this group highlights a fascinating aspect of the group's structure that sets it apart from other symmetric groups.</p>
